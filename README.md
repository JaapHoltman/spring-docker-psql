# spring-docker-psql
This is a java project that I've made for practice purposes and just for fun. I saw a lot of job offers asking for experience with Docker and PostgrSQL, so I figured that I should get familiar with these technologies. I made an backend crud application. The applicatian takes a name and a UUID.
